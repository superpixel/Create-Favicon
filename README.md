# About Create Favicon

Create Favicon is a simple droplet wrapper around the *convert* command from [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) to create a single Favicon from multiple input PNGs.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your Mac.
2. Drag & Drop the file *compile.sh* into a Terminal.app window and press Enter.
3. Create Favicon will be compiled and afterwards you can move the application wherever you want.

**Requirement:** ImageMagick needs to be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

## Usage

Launch Create Favicon to choose multiple source PNGs to convert to a single Favicon (or just Drag & Drop them onto the application).

The generated Favicon will be saved on your desktop. A random five digit number will be added to the file name if there is already a *favicon.ico* present.
